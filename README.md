# Dapp list

A curated list of Dapps featured in the Valora wallet.

Here's an example on what it looks like in action (note that it might become slightly outdated, but the general layout remains):

## Adding new dapps

If you're adding a new dapp, please read over the [Valora Dapps Page
Application](https://valoraapp.com/submit-dapp) before proceeding.

If you're ready to add a new dapp, see [Adding new
dapps](./docs/adding-new-dapps.md).

We encourage (and in many cases will require) basic documentation so
users will understand what your dapp does and how to get started. We
have summarized [Best Practices for User
Documentation](./docs/user-documentation-best-practices.md) to help dapps
author a basic documentation that we think will be effective.

## Development

```

yarn validate
```

# Best Practices for User Documentation

Provide the best user experience by covering pertinent information a
first-time user would need to fully and successfully utilize your
dapp. This information should be easy to locate and access within the
dapp.

## Suggested outline

### Intro

A short paragraph that answers the following questions:

- What is the purpose of this dapp?
- What can I do with this dapp?
- Why would I want to use this dapp?

### Instructions

Provide basic step-by-step instructions on how to use the dapp. This
can include:

- Written instructions.
- Illustrative screenshots from your dapp, Valora, or other wallets or
  dapps.
- Video instructions. Video instructions do best with audio or
  subtitles that explain what is happening in the video.

### Known gotchas

If you anticipate sources of confusion or have identified certain
cases that are buggy, you should share any clarifications or
workarounds.

You might also want to consider:

- Defining terms specific to defi or web3.
- Sharing a way users can get support from your team. This can be on any channel, including Discord, email, Twitter, etc.

## Examples

The above is a suggested template, but there are many ways to provide
excellent docs. Below are some examples of approaches a dapp could
take to provide help to their users:

- [Valoraâ€™s Quick Start Guide](https://support.valoraapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060946992-A-Quick-Guide-to-Valora)
- [Ubeswap](https://docs.ubeswap.org/)
- [MoolaMarket](https://docs.moola.market/)
- [Flywallet](https://chain-cover-7ae.notion.site/Flywallet-PRO-cUSD-Celo-Blockchain-623560f2c56643698978b5469d77de4b)
